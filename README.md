    Mintscan Explorer's Backend for Binance Chain 
</h2>

*:star: Developed / Developing by [Cosmostation](https://www.cosmostation.io/)*

## Overview

This project is sponsored by [Binance X Fellowship Program](https://binancex.dev/fellowship.html).

This repository provides backend code for [Mintscan Block Explorer for Binance Chain](https://binance.mintscan.io/).

- [chain-exporter](https://github.com/cosmostation/mintscan-binance-dex-backend/chain-exporter) watches a full node of Binance Chain and export data into PostgreSQL database.

- [mintscan](https://github.com/cosmostation/mintscan-binance-dex-backend/mintscan) is where all custom APIs are located.

**_Note that this repository is currently being developed meaning that most likely there will be many breaking changes._**

## Prerequisite

- Endpoints for [Binance Chain Node RPC](https://docs.binance.org/api-reference/node-rpc.html) and [API Server](https://docs.binance.org/api-reference/api-server.html)

- PostgreSQL Database

## Configuration

It uses human readable data-serialization configuration file format, [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

Reference `example.yaml` inside both `chain-exporter` and `mintscan`.

The configuration needs to be passed in via `config.yaml` file, so make sure to change the name to `config.yaml`.
